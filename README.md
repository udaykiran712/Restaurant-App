I have developed an online restaurant application called Restaurant App using React, and it took me two days. The application allows users to explore different menu categories, select dishes, and add them to their shopping cart. I used conditional rendering to display different components based on the API status. Since my primary focus was building the frontend part of the application, I integrated mock APIs for displaying data. During the API request, I displayed a loading spinner from the third party package, react loader spinner. If the API request fails, I have provided a retry button. When the retry button is clicked, another GET request is triggered to retrieve the data from the mock API.If the API request is successful, I display the categories of menu items available at the restaurant from the response of the Mock API. When a user clicks on a category button, I display menu list items of that specific category. I have added a shopping cart icon with the count of menu items in the header. When the user adds a menu item, the count at the cart icon will increase. I followed clean code guidelines by maintaining a consistent folder structure and used meaningful naming conventions, such as prefixing event handlers with on and creating reusable components throughout the application. To ensure a responsive design, I used media queries and flexbox for layouting.I plan to enhance the application by adding user authentication and a dedicated page for the cart. Additionally, I aim to develop a backend using Node.js and Express.js to replace the current mock API implementation.
